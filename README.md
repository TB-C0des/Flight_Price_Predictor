# Flight_Price_Predictor
In this project, we leverage historical flight data to predict airfare. The dataset includes several columns:
Airline: The airline operating the flight.
Date of Journey: The departure date.
Source: The departure city or airport.
Destination: The arrival city or airport.
Departure Time: The time of departure.
Arrival Time: The expected arrival time.
Duration: The flight duration.
Total Stops: The number of layovers or stops during the journey.
Additional Info: Any extra information related to the flight.
Using Random Forest Regression, we can create a model that learns from these features and predicts flight prices accurately. Remember to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and split it into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
